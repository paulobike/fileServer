# FILE SERVER
Simple api to upload and download files built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).


## Running the server
In order to get the server running, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

See [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to find out more about that.

Once that's out of the way, you would need to clone the [repo](https://github.com/paulobike/fileServer):

```
git clone https://github.com/paulobike/fileServer.git
```
Or with SSH

```
git clone git@github.com:paulobike/fileServer.git
```

Then navigate to the project's directory

```
cd fileServer
```

and run:

```
npm install
```

to install the dependencies.

Once dependecies are installed, the server is good to go :), simply run
```
node index.js
```
to start up the server.

HAPPY HACKING!!!
